# Basic Combat Tracker
 Small GUI application to help me remember various things in D&D combat.

Just to throw a lil bit of context into this, incase I ever end up forgetting or someone comes across this randomly:
The campaign is using the FFD20 module and my character is a Summoner with the Scholar sub-job. Nebby, or Nebula, is my precious Carbuncle summon
